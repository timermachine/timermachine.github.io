<h2>Concurrent timers (stress test)</h2>
So this is crazy and fun! Especially if like me you are partial to some extreme
noise! Its good to know the app can handle pretty much anything you throw at it.

<p>
  Experiment with text to speech, video, audio alarms. Browsers (and sanity)
  have some restrictions to what we can/want to do. For example, for audio, you
  have to interact with the page first. This is to stop those oh so annoying
  pages that play sounds/music as soon as you land on them. It was the bane of
  the internet in the early days. With video, well - you only want one with
  sound playing at a time. Period. Ever. Text to Speech is lined up for
  improvements. The built in browser synthesis only allows one utterance at a
  time. And its slow to generate. We have a solution, but its likely to stay in
  the parking lot till even cooler things are done.

<p>
  Though you are unlikely to have loads of timers go off at the same time, this
  page is useful to get to know / try out the behaviours. For example, alarms
  sound out once when set to the start of a timer, but loop when set to the end
  of a timer (so we wake up innit!).
