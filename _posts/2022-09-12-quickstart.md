Timer that plays your choice of music, speaks text, has intervals, works. Become an expert in minutes...

- Plays your choice of muisc- at start and/or end of timer.
- Text to Voice.
- Timer Intervals.
- Save Multiple Timers.
- You dont have to stay on the timer browser tab for it to work (unlike a lot of others).
- Overtimer (see how long since timer ended)

I got frustrated by all the online timers out there not working properly, and not having great features - so I made my own: Timer Machine!

Lets dive in!

### Simplest Timer
A new timer is created with the default alarm sound.
Set it to five seconds.
Start it.
When its done click the pause button. An Edit button
should show (bottom right). click it to try the next one...

### Speak Text Timer
Right, lets start having some fun:
This one will speak text out loud at the end
(We don't advise using it to prank people :wink: )

Uncheck the 'alarm sound'. -on all options there is a checkbox which enables/disables it. 

Check the 'alarm Speak' box. Enter whatever text you like. Run it.

### Music Playing Timer!!!

We think this is the most awesome feature so far.
With it you can listen to music videos from Youtube.

First to get rid of Ads you have two options:

- [Youtube Subscription (Paid for)](https://youtube.com)
 - [Brave Browser (free-no in play ads!)](https://brave.com)

Brave is a great browser - built on the most supported browser in the world (chrome), but with the best privacy and security features on top. 

Ready? Lets try it out:
Lets play some music when the timer is done first:
Click [v Advanced] on the Timer edit page.
Enable 'on end playlist'
Choose a playlist.
Start timer.
