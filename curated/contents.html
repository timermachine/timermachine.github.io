  <h1>Curated Timer Apps (BETA)</h1>
  <p>
    TimerMachine started out to provide totally customisable Timers. Turns out,
    they are so configurable that some greate teachers have made incredible
    Timers which are complete applications in their own right. Best of all, you
    can adapt them to your needs with the same powerful configuration options
    that every Timer on TimeRmachine provides.
  </p>

  <p>
    Try out any of these. Remember, Blue timers are to try out/share, they are
    not saved.

      If you like one, add it to your library to keep it with the {% include
      arrowLefticon.html %} button.

  <a href="{{ '/curated/kaizen.html' | relative_url }}" class="">Kaizen</a>
  <p>Kaizen is a term that comes from Zen, meaning continuous improvement.</p>
  <p>
    Perfect for building a good habit. Say you want to Meditate at 8pm each day.
    Its good to start small - say for two minutes. When you complete the timer,
    it will increase the duration for the next time. Here by 30 seconds. So the
    next day you will meditate for 2minutes and 30 seconds. How easy is that!
    Kaizen makes it effortless to build habits you really want to develop (but
    have resistance to). It really is mystical magic - genius in it's
    simplicity. Those Zen Monk dudes know what they were doing!
