<h1>Guide</h1>

  <p>I got frustrated by all the online timers out there not working properly or not having great features - so I made my own: Timer Machine!</p>
  <p>Lets dive in!</p>

  <h3 id="speak-text-timer">
  <span class="mr-2">Speak Text Timer:</span><a href="#speak-text-timer" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a>
  </h3>
  <p>Right, lets start having some fun:
  This one will speak text out loud at the end
  (We don’t advise using it to prank people <img class="emoji" title=":wink:" alt=":wink:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f609.png" height="20" width="20"> )</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Uncheck the ‘alarm sound’ checkbox.</li>
    <li>Check the ‘alarm Speak’ checkbox.</li>
    <li>Enter whatever text you like.</li>
    <li>Start it, and unleash the power of speach!</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>Bonus: you can speak text and have alarm sounds at the same time if you want.</p>
  
  <h3 id="intervals">
  <span class="mr-2">Intervals:</span><a href="#intervals" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a>
  </h3>
  
  <p>Intervals are useful for all sorts of timers like Meditation, Training.
  You can play sounds and or speak text - or both.</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Set the timer for say 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Click on ‘Advanced’ in a timer.</li>
    <li>check ‘interval speak’ and type in whatever you want it to say.</li>
    <li>Start it.</li>
    <li>go back and enable ‘Interval sound’ as well. now voice and the sound will play at the set interval.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h3 id="music-playing-timer">
  <span class="mr-2">Music Playing Timer:</span><a href="#music-playing-timer" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a>
  </h3>
  
  <p>We think this is the most awesome feature so far.
  With it you can listen to music videos from Youtube, Podcasts. Infact any site that auto plays when you arrive. Here we will demo using Youtube, as that is what our curated playlists use.</p>
  
  <p>First though, for youtube lets get rid of Ads. You have two options:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://youtube.com">Youtube Subscription (Paid for)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://brave.com">Brave Browser (free)</a></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Brave is a great browser - built on the most supported browser in the world (chrome), but with the best privacy and security features on top. 
  When you visit TimerMachine in Brave, you wont get any in play ads.</p>
  
  <p>Ready? Lets play some music when the timer is completed first:</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Click [v Advanced] on the Timer edit page.</li>
    <li>Uncheck any other alerts.</li>
    <li>Enable ‘on end playlist’</li>
    <li>Choose a playlist.</li>
    <li>Start timer.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>When time is up a small window should open - and start playing the playlist selected.</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Try the same but with On Start Playlist.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>Bonus: Works great with playlists at start and end.</p>
  
  <h3 id="stopwatch">
  <span class="mr-2">Stopwatch</span><a href="#stopwatch" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a>
  </h3>
  
  <p>Just start a timer without any countdown time set.</p>
